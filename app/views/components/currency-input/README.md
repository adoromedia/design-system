## When to use this component

Use the currency input to let users enter an amount of money.

## How it works

The currency input places a pound symbol next to the the input. Hidden text is announced “in pounds” for screen readers. Both the symbol and the text can be changed through configuration.

The type of the input is `text` and the pattern attribute is used so that iOS mobile devices show a numeric keypad. Read more about this in [when to use the number input](https://adamsilver.io/articles/form-design-when-to-use-the-number-input/).

## Research on this component

This component is experimental because this version has not yet been tried in research with users.

The design, code and guidance here are based on recommendations from the community and examples of the currency input in HMCTS services such as [making a money claim](https://www.gov.uk/make-money-claim).
